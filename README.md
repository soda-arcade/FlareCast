## Important Note

Parsec Soda is no longer in development, and Smash Soda is now the only working version of Parsec Soda. When Parsec shut down their arcade service, Smash Soda needed to be modified in a way that means builds of it can no longer be shared, due to Parsec's terms with their software development kit. This means you now have to compile Smash Soda yourself...which sucks, I know, but I made a build guide here: [https://mickeyuk.com/smash-soda-build-guide](https://mickeyuk.com/blog/smash-soda-build-guide)

## About the Project

This is a modification of <a href="https://github.com/FlavioFS/">ParsecSoda</a>, a tool developed by <a href="https://github.com/FlavioFS/">FlavioFS</a> for improving the hosting experience on Parsec Arcade. It builds upon modifications made by user <a href="https://github.com/v6ooo/">v6000</a>.

The aim of this project is to make it easier for people to host public rooms with Parsec, with lots of new features and moderation tools. It also uses an unofficial alternative to the now discontinued Parsec Arcade, called [Soda Arcade](https://soda-arcade.com).

This is an experimental version of Parsec Soda...expect bugs! Help development by reporting <a href="https://github.com/MickeyUK/SmashSoda/issues">issues</a> and contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/MickeyUK/SmashSoda/discussions">Discussions</a>!

## Features

  * **Smash Bros Ultimate**

  Some new admin chat commands have been added for making hosting Smash easier. **!bb** will press everybody's B button twice...good when you're stuck the the match results screen!

  * **Ping Limit**

  This allows you to set a latency limit for your lobby. Those whose pings exceed the limit will be kicked automatically.

  * **Moderator System**

  Grant moderator permissions to users you trust in your lobbies. This will allow your mods to kick troublesome users and other admin tier commands.

  * **Hotseat**

  Hosting a single player game and people aren't sharing nicely? Well now you can set a hotseat timer...when the timer is up, it'll go down the guest list and swap them in to the gamepad 1 slot!

  * **Themes**
  
  Check out the new *Midnight* theme for Smash Soda or select from some presets!
